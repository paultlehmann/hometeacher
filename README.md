Welcome to HomeTeacher!  The purpose of this application is to facilitate distance learning by allowing teachers and students to interact by creating, assigning, completing, and grading assignments and tests.

### Instructions for Use - Teachers

Begin by creating a Teacher-type account. This will give you access to your Dashboard and the features listed below.

**Creating tests/assignments**: Click "Create a new test" on your Dashboard page to open up the Test Editor. It allows you to add questions and customize other aspects of the test or assignment.

**Assigning tests/assignments**: Select your test in the "Edit or assign an existing test" section of your Dashboard. This will open the Assign Test screen, which allows you to specify a due date and select which students receive the test or assignment.

**Grading tests/assignments**: Click the "grade" button next to a test or assignment in the "Grade a submitted test" section of your Dashboard. This will automatically calculate a grade and return the graded test to the students.

### Instructions for Use - Students

Begin by creating a Student-type account. This will give you access to your Dashboard and the features listed below.

**Taking tests/assignments**: Any tests or assignments currently assigned to you will appear in the "Take a test" section of your Dashboard. Clicking on one of them will allow you to answer questions or to submit the test or save it to continue your work later.

**Reviewing grades**: Any graded tests or assignments will appear in the "Review grades" section of your Dashboard. Your grade will be displayed, and you can click the test or assignment to see the correct answers.
